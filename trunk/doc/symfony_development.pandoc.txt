### Plugins as svn:externals

To add a plugin through svn, do the following:

    svn pe svn:externals plugins
    
On the file getting edited, enter the name of the directory and the svn source:

    sfJqueryReloadedPlugin http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfJqueryReloadedPlugin/1.2/trunk

(The directory sfJqueryReloadedPlugin must NOT exist before)

Save.

Run
    svn ci -m 'added external plugin'
    svn update
    
You're done.
