# It is not possible to retrieve single files via svn when they come from a repository
# which differs from the main one.
# To update singular files, you might need to download them directly:

wget http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Loader.php -O Loader.php
wget http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Exception.php -O Exception.php
